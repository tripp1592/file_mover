# Terminal Input Commands

Terminal Command Rules:
for any thing you want me to type into a terminal (git, commands, etc) just send to me in text format
1. Never attempt to execute commands directly
2. Always provide commands as plain text in a code block
5. Do not ask for permission to run commands
6. Do not apologize for not running commands
